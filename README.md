# BuseFileSystem
The directory contains two implementations of Block device in User Space File Systems :
1) Using High Level API's from FUSE Framework,
2) Using Low Level API's from FUSE Frameowrk.

You need a Block device "/dev/sdX" to store the contents of the BuseFS. First you need to runs the format executable to lay the data structures and then the actual filesystem.
